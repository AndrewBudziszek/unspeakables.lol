# unspeakables.lol

unspeakables.lol is a small app built with React.js. This was an opportunity for me to learn a little bit about React Hooks.

unspeakables.lol picks a random bad word out of a list, provided by Carnegie Mellon University - School of Computer Science, matches it with Urban Dictionary via an API, and spits out the definition for you to chuckle at.

This app uses React and is automatically deployed on each push to `main` to via AWS Amplify.
